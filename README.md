Gym_App

This is a gym app I made using HTML, PHP, Javascript and Css. 

Users login and can sign up.

The PHP sends and retrieves data to and from an SQL database to allow personalised user sessions and use of the Gym App's functionality. 

Ajax JS allows the users to edit their statistics without reloading or changing the page as the data requests are sent assynchronously.
